R framework for evaluating causal inference algorithms and for 
validating their estimates with a stability score ("stability 
score for causal inference", SSCI).

content:

test_utils.R 		functions for generation and simulation of SEMs, for comparing and handling graphs and results from differen algorithms
scoring.R		functions for subsampling and calculation of the SSCI
example_code.R		some examples

violted_assumptions	experiments with violated assumptions, organised bottom up the files in the subfolders specify the sem and then call the upper files (sid_lin_gauss.R sid_exp_noise.R, sid_non_lin.R, sid_logistic.R, sid_unif_noise.R) to simulate the data and calculate the SID values with sid_samplesize.R. The effect interactions are specified in a seperate file for every sem in its own folder in the file interactions.R
